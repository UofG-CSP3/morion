## How to set up

Follow the guide on the [README](../README.md) page in the example directory.

As discussed there, make sure the scripts on this page can import packages in the `CSP3_project` directory.

Run the `create_test_files.py` script. This should set up the files to be used in the demonstration.

I do not recommend you running the remaining files. Instead, you should read 
through them to get an understanding on how the project API works,
and then try to create your own python scripts.
